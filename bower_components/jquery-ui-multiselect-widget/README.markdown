# jQuery UI MultiSelect Widget

MultiSelect progessively enhances an ordinary multiple select control into elegant drop down list of checkboxes, stylable with ThemeRoller.  

You might also be interested in my original [MultiSelect jQuery plugin](http://github.com/ehynds/jquery-multiselect) which does the exact same
as this widget, except without the UI widget factory.

This version, however, is recommended and is much more robust.
