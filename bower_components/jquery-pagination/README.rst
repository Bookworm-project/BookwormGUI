jQuery Pagination Plugin
========================

Description
-----------
When you have a a large list of items (e.g. search results or news articles), 
you can display them grouped in pages and present navigational elements to move 
from one page to another. This plugin creates these navigational elements. 

Usage
-----
Include jQuery, the pagination plugin script and the pagination.css file in
your HTML page. In your HTML body create a container tag pair that will hold
the link elements. Give it an id or class attribute (e.g. "News-Pagination").
This attribute can used as the selector for jQuery.

Next, write a JavaScript function that has two parameters: page_index and
paging_container. This is the callback function where you react to clicks on the
pagination links. It should select a slice from your content, depending on the
page id.::

    function handlePaginationClick(new_page_index, pagination_container) {
        // This selects 20 elements from a content array
        for(var i=new_page_id;i<;i++) {
            $('#MyContentArea').append(content[i]);
        }
        return false;
    }

The code in this callback function requires knowledge of the jQuery DOM
manipulation functions. This is where you write your display routines.
    
In the initialisation function of your page, when you know how many items you
want to display overall, create the pagination element like this:::

	// First Parameter: number of items
	// Second Parameter: options object
	$("#News-Pagination").pagination(122, {
		items_per_page:20, 
		callback:handlePaginationClick
	});

This will create the navigation links inside the container. You will see the 
numbers 1-7, the first number is highlighted. When you click on another number, 
the highlighting changes and your callback function "handlePaginationClick" 
is called.

The plugin is highly configurable through the option parameter and all elements 
can be styled separately.


Available Options
-----------------
The following list describes what options you have for the option object:

callback
	A callback function that is called when a user clicks on a pagination link. The 
	function receives two parameters: the new page index and the pagination 
	container (a DOM element). If the callback returns false, the event 
	propagation is stopped. Default value: ``function(){return false;}``.
	This callback function is essential for the functionality of the pagination!
	It should contain code that updates your content.
	For a fast user experience you should NOT load content via AJAX in this 
	function. Instead, pre-load some content pages and switch between them with
	this function.
    
current_page
	The page that is selected when the pagination is initialized. Default: 0
	
items_per_page
	The number of items per page. The maximum number of pages is calculated by
	dividing the number of items by items_per_page (rounded up, minimum 1).
	**Please note:** This value is only for calculating the number of pages. 
	The actual selection of the items correlating to the current page and
	number of items must be done by your code in your callback function!
	Default: 10
	
link_to
	Link target of the pagination links. Normally the page selection is 
	triggered through an onclick event. If the link contains the string 
	``__id__``, it will be replaced with the page number. Default: ``#``
	
num_display_entries
	Maximum number of pagination links that are visible. Set to 0 to display a
	simple "Previous/Next"-Navigation. Set to an odd number for maximum 
	symmetry and aesthetic pleasure. Default: 11
	
next_text
	Text for the "Next"-link that increases the current page number by 1. 
	Leave blank to hide the link. Default: ``Next``
	
next_show_always
	If this is set to false, the "Next"-link is only shown when the page number 
	can be increased. Default: `true`
	
prev_text
	Text for the "Previous"-link that decreases the current page number by 1. 
	Leave blank to hide the link. Default: ``Previous``
	
prev_show_always
	If this is set to false, the "Previous"-link is only shown when the page 
	number can be decreased. Default: true
	
num_edge_entries
	If this number is set to 1, links to the first and the last page are always 
	shown, independent of the current position and the visibility constraints 
	set by num_display_entries. You can set it to bigger numbers to show more 
	links. Default: 0
	
ellipse_text
	When there is a gap between the numbers created by num_edge_entries and the 
	displayed number interval, this text will be inserted into the gap (inside a
	span tag). Can be left blank to avoid the additional tag. Default: ``...``

load_first_page
	If true (default) then the callback is executed when the plugin is 
	initialized. If you load your content with AJAX and already show content
	whey you initialize the pagination, you should set this to false.

Triggering pagination with custom events
----------------------------------------
There may be use cases where you want to change the pagination from your own
JavaScript code. For example in a wizard or a questionnaire you skip pages if
a certain option is not selected. Or clicking on images in an image gallery
should trigger the "next page" event. For these use cases you use jQuery
custom events like this:::

	// Jump to the 5th page 
	$("#News-Pagination").trigger('setPage', [4]);
	// Go to the next page
	$("#News-Pagination").trigger('nextPage');
	// Go to the previous page
	$("#News-Pagination").trigger('prevPage');

The event handlers check if the new page number is inside the boundaries of the number of pages and ignore the event if it is outside.

initialized.

Future Plans
------------
   * Optional links for jumping a fixed number of pages.
   * Trigger events when a page is selected.
   * Implement paginaton as a jQuery UI widget.
   * More renderers for rendering the Pagination elements differently.
   * Documentation and examples how you implement your own renderers.
   * Write unit tests and use QUnit instead of JSUnit.

I'll implement these features as I see fit and when my time allows it. If 
you'd like to see any of those features *now*, feel free to contact me and we 
can discuss a reasonable fee.

I'd be glad if you could send me a notice where you use jQuery Pagination. 
Knowing common use cases will help me to improve the plugin in the future.
